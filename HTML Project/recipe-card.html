	  <!--About the Food or Meal origin -->
	  <section class="About Mtori">
	  	 <p><strong>Swahili Beef Mtori Soup</strong> is a popular Tanzanian stew made of bananas and meat. The soup originated in the Kilimanjaro area of Tanzania, specifically Moshi-Arusha region. Mtori is often eaten by Maasai women during a three month period postpartum confinement for nutrition. This dish can be served as a main course and can be eaten during breakfast, lunch or dinner.
				  		The Tanzanians are famous for cooking this dish and it is usually served with chapati.<span style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: italic;font-weight: bold; color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.54);"> </span></p>

	  <h3>Method/Preparation Steps<span style="font-size: 12px; font-style: italic;font-weight: lighter;"></span></h3>
	  <ul>
	  <li>Put the beef, enough cold water to cover the beef, and salt in a large casserole pot and bring to a boil over high  heat. 
	  Skim the foam and scum as they rise to the surface.</li>
	  <li>Reduce the heat to low and simmer, partially covered, for 1 to 11/2 hours. 
	  Then remove the shortribs from the water. Strain the water, as this will be your stock for later. </li>
	  <li>Allow the meat to cool slightly and then remove all the meat from the bone. Now chop the meat into small   cubes and place it aside. </li>
	  <li>Heat a large pot to a medium heat. Add the butter, onions, garlic, cumin and coriander spice and sauté whilst stirring until you have a light golden brown colour.</li>
	  <li>Now add the plantains (green banana), potatoes, tomato, carrots and herbs. 
	  Sauté slowly for a further 6 to 10 minutes whilst stirring to ensure all the flavour is even, enhanced and all ingredients slightly browned. </li>
	  <li>Now add the beef water (stock) back and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes until the plantains and potatoes are soft.
	  Remove from heat and blend the soup, but only use the pulse blender mode to ensure that the soup is not entirely smooth. 
	  The soup should have a rustic, chunky and thick texture. Then return to the pot.</li>
	  <li>Return the blended soup to the slow heat. Now add the chopped beef, coconut milk, salt and pepper and simmer until the soup reduces to a desired thickness. 
	  Double check the flavour and season to taste.</li>
	</ul>
